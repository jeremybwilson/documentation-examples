<center>In the above example, we have multiple menus: Footer (main) menu, Footer (copyright) menu, Account Sidebar, Landing Page sidenav, and Main menu.  For the footer we only need two of these menus, the ***Footer*** and ***Footer (copyright) menu***.</center>

<center>Let's look at the footer on the live site before we dive any further into the Navigation tools.</center>

1. **Footer (main) menu**
	- primary navigation menus for the site footer element.

2. **Footer (copyright) menu**
	- called as such because of it's location directly underneath the site copyright credits.

<center>Let's open up *Footer (main) menu* and see how it's set up.</center>

####B. Footer Menu: About Us, Customer Service, and Quick Links

![Footer Navigation About (redacted) step 1](https://i.imgur.com/yKRzqgT.png)

<center>**Next:**  The next step is to select from the available "Pages" <br />which will auto-populate from those available in the Pages section of the Shopify Admin panel.</center>

####Link features:
1. **EXTERNAL (URL) LINKING:**
	- Paste into the "Link" field any external URL.
		- *<strong>EX:</strong> <https://--YOUR-STORE--.myshopify.com/admin/pages>*
	- Click "Apply changes" to save your changes to the menu item.


<center>**Next:** How to populate the Footer (privacy) menu.</center>


***

####A.  Footer (copyright) menu:  
The privacy menu in the footer is largely the same configuration as the previous example except that this menu has only one level and therefore no nesting.  Adding any additional links here should see them wrap and remain centered on the page.

**Copyright menu features:**

1. One level deep, no nesting like the previous example however additional links will wrap.

<center>Here is the footer (copyright) menu on the site.</center>
